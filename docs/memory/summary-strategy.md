# Summary Strategy

## Purpose

Conversation summaries exist to preserve continuity without relying on raw message history.

They allow Justin Lite to:

- maintain context across longer conversations
- reduce cognitive and token load
- support deliberate reflection
- avoid overfitting to individual messages

Summaries are a structural tool, not a shortcut to insight.

---

## Why Summaries Are Necessary

Raw conversation history is:

- verbose
- noisy
- emotionally uneven
- expensive to process at scale

More data does not automatically create better understanding.

Summaries allow Justin Lite to retain _meaning_ while discarding excess detail.

---

## What a Summary Represents

A summary is:

- a neutral condensation of prior exchanges
- focused on themes, not dialogue
- descriptive rather than interpretive

Summaries do not:

- analyze motives
- assign identity
- speculate on intent
- replace the user’s voice

They exist to establish context, not conclusions.

---

## When Summaries Are Created

Summaries are generated:

- after a defined number of messages
- at deliberate intervals, not continuously
- only once sufficient context exists

This batching prevents:

- premature interpretation
- summary drift
- overreaction to single moments

Summarization cadence is intentional and conservative.

---

## How Summaries Are Generated

Summaries are produced by the AI system using:

- prior summaries (if present)
- recent message windows
- neutral summarization prompts

The goal is:

- clarity
- continuity
- restraint

Each summary builds upon the previous one rather than rewriting the entire history.

---

## How Summaries Are Used

Summaries are injected as **system-level context** during response generation.

They:

- inform tone
- provide continuity
- support pattern recognition

They do not:

- override current messages
- dominate responses
- present themselves as truth

The current conversation always takes priority.

---

## Summaries and Reflection

Summaries are a prerequisite for reflection, not reflection itself.

Reflection may draw from summaries when:

- patterns repeat across summaries
- sufficient time and context exist
- reflection thresholds are met

A summary alone does not justify reflection.

---

## Summary Limits

Summaries are intentionally constrained:

- they are concise
- they avoid emotional labeling
- they are revisable
- they can be superseded by new context

Justin Lite prefers evolving summaries over accumulating ones.

---

## Error Tolerance and Safety

If a summary is:

- incomplete
- slightly imprecise
- missing nuance

It is treated as _contextual support_, not authority.

Summaries are allowed to be imperfect.
They are not treated as final representations of the user.

---

## Design Rationale

This strategy balances:

- continuity and humility
- usefulness and restraint
- performance and ethics

Summaries exist to serve understanding, not control it.

---

## Closing Statement

Summaries are scaffolding, not structure.

They support reflection without replacing the conversation itself.

Meaning is preserved.
Detail is released.
Context remains flexible.
